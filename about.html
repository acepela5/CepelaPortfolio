                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Hello all, my name is Adi Cepela. I am a recentgraduate of a Web Development Bootcamp from Northwestern University, as well as a graduate
                            of VanderCook College of Music with my Bachelor's
                            Degree in Music Education.
                            In music school we learned how to teach and play 21 instruments while honing skills on our
                            primary; for me,
                            that was the violin.
                            These four years since graduating have been spent teaching middle school orchestra to
                            diverse
                            communities of students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From those four years of teaching, I learned many skills that have come in handy outside of the classroom; organizational, communication, ability to work with peers and individually, and planning both goals and events. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During that time I would happen to see an advertisment for coding bootcamps and would become more interested every time I saw one. I began looking into what coding jobs exsisted; lo and behold there are jobs that are based on being creative, organized, communicative, all of the aspects that I loved about being a teacher in a completely different setting. After months, I finally bit the bullet and signed up to enroll! Now I have a new set of skills that I never would have imagined having and cannot wait to put these coding hands to good use. 
                        </p>
                        <p>When the oppertunity for freetime arrises, I love to exercise, eat, and bake lots of goodies. In my free time I
                            still enjoy
                            performing with the Lakeview Orchestra and playing weddings with other musician friends.
                            My husband, Paul, and I have two cats with lots of personality, Mahler and Elgar. Both are
                            named after
                            composers we enjoy listening to. If you haven't heard of either, you should look up Gustav
                            Mahler's
                            Symphony No. 5 and Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto.
                        </p>
